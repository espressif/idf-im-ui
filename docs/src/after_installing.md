# After Installing

## Windows

On Windows, the installer creates a desktop icon labeled **IDF\_PowerShell**. Clicking this icon will launch PowerShell with the environment set up, allowing you to start using ESP-IDF immediately. If you've installed multiple versions, you will have multiple icons, one for each version.

## macOS & Linux

In the installation directory you selected, there will be a `.sh` script that, when sourced, activates the ESP-IDF environment in your current shell. If you've installed multiple versions of ESP-IDF, there will be a separate script for each version.

> **Note**
> The script must be sourced and not executed\!
