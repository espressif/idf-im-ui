# After Installing

## Windows

On Windows, the installer creates an icon on your desktop labeled IDF_PowerShell. Clicking this icon will launch PowerShell with the environment set up, allowing you to start using ESP-IDF immediately. If you’ve installed multiple versions of ESP-IDF, you will have multiple icons, one for each version.

## macOS & Linux

In the installation directory you selected, there will be a .sh script that, when sourced, activates the ESP-IDF environment in your current shell. It’s important to note that this script should be sourced, not executed directly. If you’ve installed multiple versions of ESP-IDF, there will be a separate script for each version.

> **Note**  
> The script should be really sourced and not executed
