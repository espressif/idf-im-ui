# Installation Methods

The ESP-IDF Installation Manager (EIM) offers multiple ways to install ESP-IDF based on your needs:

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The GUI installer provides two installation modes:

1. **Simplified Installation**: A streamlined process with default settings - ideal for most users who want to quickly get started with ESP-IDF development.

2. **Expert Installation**: Offers full control over the installation process through a wizard interface - recommended for users who need specific configurations.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI version is ideal for:
- Automated installations
- CI/CD pipelines
- Docker environments
- Users who prefer command line tools

You can use the CLI in two ways:
1. **Interactive Mode**: Run without parameters for a step-by-step wizard
2. **Headless Mode**: Use command line arguments for automated installations

## Offline Installation

For environments without an internet connection, EIM provides an offline installation method. This involves downloading a single archive that contains all the necessary components. For more details, see the [Offline Installation](./offline_installation.md) guide.

Choose the installation method that best suits your needs and workflow.
