In case of any issues during the installation process, the user can consult the installation log for more information, where the reason for the failure can be found.

In that case the user can try to re-run the installation process clicking on the "Try again" button (usually after he resolves the issue manually) or try to switch to the advanced installation option by clicking on the "Expert mode" button.
